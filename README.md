# Data_Analysis_Tools
Here's a list of al tools you will need to become a skilled Data Analyst

I started taking the Data Analytics course to certify my skills and receive expert guidance in this Career.
As part of the course, we are allowed to share contents we learn in class.
So far, I've become quite friendly with Python libraries and Microsoft Excel.
I started up on Matplotlib but got quite confused so I decided to start up with SQL first.
I'm experiencing major challenges with installing Microsoft SQL Server.

A brief guide however, Pandas is necessary especially on manipulating and cleaning data sets with Python.
NumPy is similar to Python Arrays but simpler and easier to use.
MatplotLib is used for visualization and graphical represenation.
I'll soon prepare an article about these libraries when I'm done with the course.
